    description: `In this Hugo Award–winning alternative history classic—the basis for the Amazon Original series—the United States lost World War II and was subsequently divided between the Germans in the East and the Japanese in the West.\nIt’s America in 1962. Slavery is legal once again. The few Jews who still survive hide under assumed names. In this world, we meet characters like Frank Frink, a dealer of counterfeit Americana who is himself hiding his Jewish ancestry; Nobusuke Tagomi, the Japanese trade minister in San Francisco, unsure of his standing within the bureaucracy and Japan's with Germany; and Juliana Frink, Frank's ex-wife, who may be more important than she realizes.\nThese seemingly disparate characters gradually realize their connections to each other just as they realize that something is not quite right about their world. And it seems as though the answers might lie with Hawthorne Abendsen, a mysterious and reclusive author, whose best-selling novel describes a world in which the US won the War... The Man in the High Castle is Dick at his best, giving readers a harrowing vision of the world that almost was.\n“The single most resonant and carefully imagined book of Dick’s career.”—New York Times`,

    description: `Newspeak, Doublethink, Big Brother, the Thought Police - the language of 1984 has passed into the English language as a symbol of the horrors of totalitarianism. George Orwell's story of Winston Smith's fight against the all-pervading Party has become a classic, not the least because of its intellectual coherence. First published in 1949, it retains as much relevance today as it had then.`,

    title: "Animal Farm",
    author: "George Orwell",
    cover: "/books/Animal Farm 75th Anniversary.jpg",
    description: `The description of Animal Farm Book: Overworked and mistreated animals one day gather and take over the farm where they live. They finally have a say, determined to create a more just and equal society on the farm. They begin to work to establish this new order under the leadership of the pigs. Although this order helped the farm to develop at first, problems that the animals could not foresee will arise over time and a more brutal regime will be established than before. Animal Farm is George Orwell's second well-known modern classic novel and a striking political satire. One of the best critiques of the system ever written, this novel reveals how a liberation revolution can evolve into one-manhood. George Orwell's allegory remains relevant today in every situation and place where freedom is attacked.`,

Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of Paul Atreides—who would become known as Muad'Dib—and of a great family's ambition to bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream.

A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.`,
